# Easy Web Firewall rules definition file.
#
# This rules definition file is designed to be as easy as possible. Lines starting
# with a dash (`#`) are ignored, whereas each other line defines a rule using the
#Â following format (fields are separated by any number of spaces or tabs):
#
#    Action  UID         Destination             Port
#
# Where:
#
# - 'Action' is the action to take on connections matching this rule, being one of:
#       A : Allow the connection to go through.
#       I : Block this connection without logging (ignore).
#
# - `UID` is the UID or range of UIDs of the matching users, while an asterisk
#   (`*`) matches any user.
#   Examples: `1000`, `1000-200`, `*`.
#
# - `Destination` is an IP address or CIDR block matching the connection's
#   destination IP, while an asterisk (`*`) matches any destination IP.
#   Examples: 127.0.0.1/8, 1.2.3.4, *.
#
# - `Port` is the port or port range of the connection, while an asterisk `(*`)
#   matches any port.
#   Examples: 80, 8000-8005, *.

# Local connections
A *		127.0.0.1/8		*
