# Easy Web Firewall tinyproxy ignore file.
#
# This ignore file defines (per user) URLs that should be ignored by the proxy
# reporter. User/URL combinations defined here will never be reported to the admin
# when such connections are blocked. This is useful to ignore spammy software that
# tries to fetch many external URLs.
#
# This file's format is straightforward. Lines starting with a 
# dash (`#`) are ignored, whereas each other line defines a rule using the
#Â following format (fields are separated by any number of spaces or tabs):
#
#    UID         Destination
#
# Where:
#
# - `UID` is the UID or range of UIDs of the matching users, while an asterisk
#   (`*`) matches any user.
#   Examples: `1000`, `1000-200`, `*`.
#
# - `Destination` is a regular expression. If the inspected URL matches the regex,
#   the software will *not* report it (and matching stops). Otherwise the next rule
#   is tested. If no rule matches, the URL will be reported by email to the sysadmin.
#   Examples: `^api.wordpress.com:443`, `http://google.es/`
#
